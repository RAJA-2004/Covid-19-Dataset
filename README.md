# COVID-19 Dataset

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant impact globally, resulting in the loss of numerous lives and recovery of many individuals. With vast amounts of data to be analyzed by the World Health Organization, it is crucial to have an efficient system in place to track and analyze the situation. To create awareness about the COVID-19 situation worldwide and to recognize the tireless efforts of healthcare workers, I have taken on the challenge to automate this process using the Python programming language.<br>
